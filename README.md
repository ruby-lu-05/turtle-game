# The Hungry Turtle

A simple graphics-based game involving a hungry turtle.

## Summary:
* The user plays as a turtle (they can move the turtle character around by using the arrow keys)
* There are two walls that the turtle can't run into (collision detection)
* There are also red circles moving around in patterns; these represent enemies
* The goal is to feed the turtle. There is food around the map, but only half of it is edible by the turtle
* The edible foods are random (different each game)
* The user will be shown which foods are edible for a few seconds at the beginning, and they must remember
* The user moves around the map to make the turtle eat food
* The game is won when all the edible food on the map is eaten
* The game is lost when the turtle eats an inedible food, or touches one of the moving red enemies
